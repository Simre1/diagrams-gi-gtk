A rendering backend for drawing
[diagrams](http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams) directly to GTK
windows, built on top of the diagrams-cairo backend.

The function 'renderWithContext' is from [https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/blob/master/examples/advanced/Cairo.hs] and the remainder of the package is based on [https://hackage.haskell.org/package/diagrams-gtk].
